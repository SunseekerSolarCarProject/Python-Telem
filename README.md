**Telemetry Application**\
This is the newer telemetry that I have rebuilt up in python and any one can read for newcommers into coding.

**Windows**\
The files for the executable for windows is within the output folder where you can download the application that is needed to just execute.

**Macs**\
To run on my it is more of an execution within your mac terminal. It should look something like this to execute the file. 
1. The first step is download the entire project to your mac from github.
2. This is to open your terminal within that folder
3. then enter this line of code Python3 main_app.py
This should start the application for the code to run on your mac.

Devs that created a new executable for the telemetry software on windows side goes this way. Make sure auto-py-to-exe is installed with this command 'pip install auto-py-to-exe'. then once it is installed run this command 'python -m auto-py-to-exe' within the console of your choice of software to program with.

The code was created in VS code but the method should not change too much in how to execute these choices.
